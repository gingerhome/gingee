# GingerJS: The App Developer's Guide

Welcome to GingerJS! This guide is your starting point for building powerful, secure, and modern applications on the GingerJS platform. We'll take you from a simple "Hello World" to a complete, database-backed RESTful API.

If you haven't already, please read the Core Concepts [MD](./concepts.md) [HTML](./concepts.html) guide for a high-level overview of the platform's architecture.

## Chapter 1: Your First App - Hello World

The fastest way to get started is with the `gingerjs-cli`. After you've created your first project with `gingerjs-cli init my-project`, you can create your first application.

```bash
cd my-project
gingerjs-cli add-app first-app
```

The CLI will scaffold a new, working application in the `web/first-app/` directory. Let's look at the three most important files it created:

1.  **`web/first-app/index.html`**: The main HTML page.
2.  **`web/first-app/scripts/cl_app.js`**: The client-side JavaScript for the `index.html` page.
3.  **`web/first-app/box/hello.js`**: A server-side script.

Run your server with `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:7070/first-app`. You'll see the page and an interactive "Say Hello" button. This works because of GingerJS's **File-Based Routing**:

-   The request for the page (`/first-app`) serves the static `index.html`.
-   The button's click handler in `cl_app.js` makes a `fetch` call to `/first-app/hello`.
-   Because this URL has no file extension, GingerJS automatically executes the server script at `web/first-app/box/hello.js`.

## Chapter 2: The Server Script & the `$g` Global

Let's look inside `web/first-app/box/hello.js`. All GingerJS server scripts follow this simple structure:

```javascript
module.exports = async function() {
    await ginger(async ($g) => {
        // Your application logic lives here!
        $g.response.send({ message: 'Hello from the first-app server script!' });
    });
};
```

-   **`module.exports`**: Each script is a standard Node.js module that exports a single `async` function.
-   **`await ginger(handler)`**: This globally available function is the heart of the system. It wraps your logic, providing security and automatically handling complex tasks like parsing the request body. You should always `await` it.
-   **`$g`**: The single, powerful "global" object passed to your handler. It's your secure gateway to everything you need.

Let's modify the script to take a query parameter:

```javascript
// in web/first-app/box/hello.js
await ginger(async ($g) => {
    const name = $g.request.query.name || 'World';
    $g.response.send({ message: `Hello, ${name}!` });
});
```

Now, navigate to `/first-app/hello?name=Ginger` and you'll see the personalized response. All query parameters are automatically parsed for you in `$g.request.query`.

*For a full breakdown of all properties on `$g`, see the Server Script & $g Object Reference [MD](./server-script.md) [HTML](./server-script.html)*

## Chapter 3: Building a RESTful API with `routes.json`

While file-based routing is great for simple pages, a real API needs clean, dynamic URLs (e.g., `/posts/123`). For this, we use manifest-based routing.

1.  Create a file at `web/first-app/box/routes.json`.
2.  Define your application's routes in this file.

**`web/first-app/box/routes.json`**
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "path": "/posts",
      "method": "POST",
      "script": "api/posts/create.js"
    },
    {
      "path": "/posts/:postId",
      "method": "GET",
      "script": "api/posts/get.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now, a `POST` request to `/first-app/posts` will execute `box/api/posts/create.js`. A `GET` request to `/first-app/posts/abc-123` will execute `box/api/posts/get.js`.

In your script, you can access the dynamic `:postId` parameter via `$g.request.params`.

**`web/first-app/box/api/posts/get.js`**
```javascript
module.exports = async function() {
    await ginger(async ($g) => {
        const postId = $g.request.params.postId; // "abc-123"
        
        // ... logic to fetch post from database ...

        $g.response.send({ id: postId, title: 'My First Post' });
    });
};
```

## Chapter 4: Connecting to the Database

GingerJS makes database interaction simple and secure.

1.  **Configure:** First, run `gingerjs-cli add-app my-blog` and follow the wizard to configure your database. This will populate the `db` section of your `web/my-blog/box/app.json`.
2.  **Query:** Use the powerful, sandboxed `db` module in your scripts.

**`web/my-blog/box/api/posts/get.js` (with DB logic)**
```javascript
module.exports = async function() {
    await ginger(async ($g) => {
        const db = require('db');
        const postId = $g.request.params.postId;
        const DB_NAME = 'main_db'; // The 'name' from your app.json

        try {
            const sql = 'SELECT * FROM "Posts" WHERE "id" = $1';
            const post = await db.query.one(DB_NAME, sql, [postId]);

            if (post) {
                $g.response.send(post);
            } else {
                $g.response.send({ error: 'Post not found' }, 404);
            }
        } catch (err) {
            $g.log.error('Failed to fetch post', { postId, error: err.message });
            $g.response.send({ error: 'Internal Server Error' }, 500);
        }
    });
};
```

-   **`db.query.one`**: Fetches a single record.
-   **`db.query.many`**: Fetches an array of records.
-   **`db.execute`**: Use for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. Returns the number of rows affected.
-   **Security:** Always use parameters (`$1`, `$2`) to prevent SQL injection. The `db` module handles this securely.

## Chapter 5: Using the Standard Library (App Modules)

Let's secure our `POST /posts` endpoint and validate its input.

1.  **Create an Auth Middleware:** Create `web/my-blog/box/auth_middleware.js`.
    ```javascript
    module.exports = async function() {
        await ginger(async ($g) => {
            const auth = require('auth');
            const token = $g.request.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
            const payload = auth.jwt.verify(token);

            if (!payload) {
                // This call ends the request and prevents the main handler from running.
                $g.response.send({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, 401);
            }
        });
    };
    ```
2.  **Enable the Middleware:** In `web/my-blog/box/app.json`, add it to the `default_include` array. Now it will run before every script in your app.
    ```json
    "default_include": ["auth_middleware.js"]
    ```
3.  **Validate Input:** In your `create.js` script, use the `utils` module.
    **`web/my-blog/box/api/posts/create.js`**
    ```javascript
    module.exports = async function() {
        await ginger(async ($g) => {
            const { validate } = require('utils');
            const { title, content } = $g.request.body;

            if (validate.isEmpty(title)) {
                return $g.response.send({ error: 'Title is required.' }, 400);
            }
            // ... insert into database ...
        });
    };
    ```

## Chapter 6: A New Paradigm - Building with a GenAI Partner

GingerJS was co-authored with a Generative AI, and you can leverage this same powerful workflow to build your own applications. The key is to provide the AI with a "knowledge bundle" of the platform's architecture. We've created this for you.

**How to Start a Development Session with an AI:**

1.  **Get the Context File:** Locate the pre-built `docs/ai-context.md` file in the GingerJS repo. This file contains all the core concepts and API references of GingerJS that an AI needs.

2.  **Start a New Chat:** Open a new session with a capable coding AI partner (like Google Gemini).

3.  **Use the Priming Prompt:** Your very first message should be to upload or paste the **entire contents** of the `ai-context.md` file, preceded by this simple instruction:

    > **You are an expert developer for a Node.js application server called GingerJS. Your goal is to help me build a new application on this platform by exclusively using the following context, documentation, and API reference. Analyze it carefully and confirm when you are ready to begin.**
    >
    > `[PASTE THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF ai-context.md HERE]`

4.  **Give it a Task:** Once the AI confirms it has processed the information, you can start giving it high-level tasks.

    > **Example Follow-up Prompt:**
    >
    > "Great. Now, using GingerJS, let's build the `create.js` script for our blog. It should handle a `POST` request to `/posts`, take a JSON body with `title` and `content`, validate that `title` is not empty and has a max length of 100 characters, insert the new post into our `main_db` PostgreSQL database, and return the newly created post with its ID."

The AI now has all the context it needs to generate high-quality, secure, and idiomatic GingerJS code, dramatically accelerating your development process.

## Chapter 7: Distributing Your Application

Once you have built and tested your application, GingerJS makes it easy to package it for distribution, either publicly or within your organization. A properly packaged app is a self-contained `.gin` file that includes all necessary code, assets, and security manifests.

There are three key steps to preparing your app for distribution.

**1. Declare Your Permissions (`pmft.json`)**

This is the most important step for security and user trust. You must declare what protected GingerJS modules your app needs.

*   Create a file at `web/my-app/box/pmft.json`.
*   Define the `mandatory` and `optional` permissions.

**`web/my-app/box/pmft.json`**
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "mandatory": [
      "db",
      "fs"
    ],
    "optional": [
      "httpclient"
    ]
  }
}
```
*For a full list of permissions, see the Permissions Guide.*

**2. Control Package Contents (`.gpkg`)**

Create a `.gpkg` manifest in your `box` folder to exclude any development-only files (like local SQLite databases or frontend source code in SPA) from the final package.

**`web/my-app/box/.gpkg`**
```json
{
  "include": ["**/*"],
  "exclude": [
    "box/data/**",
    "dev_src/**",
    ".gpkg",
    "pmft.json"
  ]
}
```

**3. Create the Package (`.gin`)**

With the manifests in place, you can now create the final distributable package using the `gingerjs-cli`. This command connects to your running local server to create the package.

```bash
# Make sure your local GingerJS server is running
npm start

# Package the 'my-app' application
gingerjs-cli package-app --appName my-app
```

This will generate a versioned `.gin` file (e.g., `my-app-v1.2.0.gin`) in your current directory. This single file is all anyone needs to install your application on their own GingerJS server using the `gingerjs-cli install-app` command.
