# Gingee - Application Server

## **A Gen AI Project**

[**See AI Disclaimer**](./docs/ai-disclaimer.md)

The objective of the project is to validate the feasibility of GenAI in platform/framework level programming as opposed to generating simplistic applications and in the process be the world's first AI authored and human co-authored production ready application server. To ensure full transparency, a key part of the development has been the meticulous recording of the chat transcript. You can find the link to the transcript below

**What is Gingee?**

Gingee is a secure, batteries-included Node.js application server designed to dramatically accelerate web app development. Co-authored by a human architect and a GenAI partner, it provides a full featured platform that allows developers to focus on business logic instead of boilerplate. It achieves this through a secure sandbox, a powerful module ecosystem, and a comprehensive application lifecycle management system.

## **Key Features**

Gingee is a comprehensive platform designed to provide a secure, efficient, and enjoyable development experience.

- **Secure by Default**
  - **Whitelist Permissions System:** Applications have no access to the filesystem, database, or network by default. Administrators grant explicit permissions for a "secure by default" posture.
  - **Sandboxed Execution:** Every server script runs in a secure `gbox` sandbox, isolated from the host system and other applications.

- **Instant Time to Joy**
  - **All-in-One CLI:** A single command (`gingee-cli init`) scaffolds a complete, runnable project with a built-in admin panel.
  - **Simplified API:** All request/response logic is handled through a single, powerful context object (`$g`) provided by the `gingee()` middleware.
  - **Flexible Routing:** Use zero-configuration file-based routing for rapid development, or create a `routes.json` for powerful, dynamic RESTful APIs.
  - **Modern JavaScript:** Use modern ESM syntax (`import`/`from`) directly in your server scripts with zero build steps or configuration.

- **Batteries-Included Backend**
  - **Multi App Hosting:** Deploy and run multiple apps with clear isolation, individual app lifecycles and hot app reloads.
  - **Multi-Database Support:** Write your code once and deploy against PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, and more, with a consistent API.
  - **Rich Standard Library:** A comprehensive suite of sandboxed modules for common tasks, including `crypto`, `image` processing, `pdf` generation, `db` access, and an `httpclient`.
  - **Application Startup Hooks:** Define `startup_scripts` to automatically run database migrations or seed data when your app is installed or upgraded.
  - **Application Middleware:** Define `default_include` to automatically inject scripts in front of all API end points of the app. Enabling easy authentication, policies, role management etc.

- **Full Lifecycle & Automation**
  - **Glade Admin UI:** A built-in, secure web panel for managing the entire application lifecycle (install, upgrade, rollback, delete, manage permissions) with no command line needed.
  - **Interactive Installers:** Both the CLI and the Glade UI feature intelligent installers that read an app's requirements, prompt the admin for permission consent, and guide them through database configuration.
  - **Automated Deployments:** All lifecycle commands in the CLI can be run non-interactively using a preset file, making it perfect for CI/CD pipelines.
  - **Automatic Maintenance Mode:** The server automatically puts an application into a `503 Service Unavailable` state during critical lifecycle events to ensure data integrity.
  - **Built for Scale:** With a pluggable distributed caching system (Redis), native service installation, and PM2 compatibility.

- **Decentralized App Store**
  - Discover and install applications from any `gstore.json` manifest on the web using the `gingee-cli`. Anyone can host their own public or private app store.

- **GenAI-Native Workflow**
  - Co-authored by a human architect and a Generative AI partner, Gingee is a testament to a new, highly efficient "Dialog-Driven Development" workflow. The project includes a pre-built knowledge bundle (`ai-context.md`) to empower you to build your own apps with an AI partner.


## **ðŸš€ Quick Start**

Get a new, fully configured Gingee server running in under a minute.

```bash
# 1. Install the Gingee CLI
npm install -g gingee-cli

# 2. Create a new Gingee project
gingee-cli init my-gingee-project

# 3. Navigate into your new project
cd my-gingee-project

# 4. Start the server!
npm start

# 5. Browse to http://localhost:7070
```

That's it! You should now see Glade - the Gingee admin panel in your web browser.
